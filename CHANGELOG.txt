== 0.2+ TODO ===
 *	Speed up rendering speed (prerender next slides ?)
 *	Editing needs to include author and copyright information, and this
	information needs to be displayed on the screen with the CCLI#
 *	Playlists: All; (Generic, Lyrics, etc); custom playlists
 *	Presentation List should have another column with the icon of the current
	type (general, lyrics)
 *	Preferences Dialog: Presentation background, ccli#
 *	Help Contents
 *	Preview screen shows a scaled version of the actual screen when it is
	visible, but should show a scaled version all the time to improve the look.
 *	Online retrieval of lyrics. Eventually needs to have login (generated id
	and key) to be legal (research who we'll have to pay).
