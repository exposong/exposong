# Version 0.4 #

  * Edit Dialog needs to be extended and cleaned up
  * On screen information: Author, copyright, ccli

# Version 1.0 #

  * Help Contents
  * Speed up rendering speed (prerender next slides ?)
  * Preview screen shows a scaled version of the actual screen when it is visible, but should show a scaled version all the time to improve the look.

# Future Version #

  * Online subscription of lyrics. Has to have generated id and key, and we'll have to charge and pay for use of songs. Another option is to use [Song Select](http://ccli.com/usa/WhatWeOffer/SongSelect.aspx), but that would eliminate any sort of profit from the program, and may be more expensive than if we provided it ourself.
