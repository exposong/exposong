# The variable DATA_PATH can be used to customize where the data will be
# stored. If no value is specified, it defaults to ~/exposong/data
#
# The following example uses "data" directly under the program directory:
#
#DATA_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)),'data')
#
# Or you can use "~/Documents/exposong"
# directory.

#DATA_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'),'Documents','exposong')
