Send the light! Send the light!

And a golden offering at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!</slide><slide title="Verse 3">Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christlike spirit everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!</slide><slide title="Verse 4">Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!</slide></presentation>
