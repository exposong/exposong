<presentation type="lyric"><title>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</title><slide title="Verse 1">Guide me, O thou great Jehovah, 
Pilgrim through this barren land.  
I am weak, but thou art mighty; 
Hold me with thy powerful hand.  
Bread of heaven, bread of heaven, 
Feed me till I want no more; 
Feed me till I want no more.</slide><slide title="Verse 2">Open now the crystal fountain, 
Whence the healing stream doth flow; 
Let the fire and cloudy pillar 
Lead me all my journey through.  
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer, 
Be thou still my strength and shield; 
Be thou still my strength and shield.</slide><slide title="Verse 3">When I tread the verge of Jordan, 
Bid my anxious fears subside; 
Death of death and hell's destruction, 
Land me safe on Canaan's side.  
Songs of praises, songs of praises, 
I will ever give to thee; 
I will ever give to thee.</slide></presentation>
