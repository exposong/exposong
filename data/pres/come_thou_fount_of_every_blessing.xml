Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.</slide><slide id="6CSoGu3C">Teach me ever to adore Thee,
May I still Thy goodness prove,
While the hope of endless glory
FIlls my heart with joy and love.</slide><slide id="verse2_zcLdsipP" title="Verse 2">Here I raise my Ebenezer;
Hither by Thy great help I've come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home;</slide><slide id="ZiSdS6iY">Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.</slide><slide id="verse3_hQ7q7A0d" title="Verse 3">O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.</slide><slide id="LWuQ7tT4">Never let me wander from Thee,
Never leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.</slide></presentation>
