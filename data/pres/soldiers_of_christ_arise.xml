And put your armor on;
Strong in the strength which God supplies, Strong in the strength which God supplies,
Through His beloved Son.</slide><slide title="Verse 2">Strong in the Lord of hosts,
And in His mighty power;
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
Is more than conqueror.</slide><slide title="Verse 3">Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
But take, to arm you for the fight,
But take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God;</slide><slide title="Verse 4">Leave no unguarded place,
No weakness of the soul;
Take every virtue, every grace,
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole;</slide><slide title="Verse 5">That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts passed;
You may o'ercome through Christ alone,
You may o'ercome through Christ alone,
And stand entire at last.</slide></presentation>
