Is more than conqueror.</slide><slide id="verse3_1B8Smw9k" title="Verse 3">Stand then in His great might,

And fortify the whole;</slide><slide id="verse5_Gv52Nhti" title="Verse 5">That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts passed;
You may o'ercome through Christ alone,
You may o'ercome through Christ alone,
And stand entire at last.</slide></presentation>
