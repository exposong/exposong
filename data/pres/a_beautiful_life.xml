By helping those who are in need;
My life on earth is but a span,
And so I'll do the best I can.</slide><slide title="Refrain">Life's evening sun is sinking low,
A few more days and I must go
To meet the deeds that I have done,
Where there will be no setting sun.</slide><slide title="Verse 2">To be a child of God each day,
My light must shine along the way;
I'll sing His praise while ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul.</slide><slide title="Verse 3">The only life that will endure,
Is one that's kind and good and pure;
And so for God I'll take my stand,
Each day I'll lend a helping hand.</slide><slide title="Verse 4">While going down life's weary road
I'll try to lift some trav'ler's load;
I'll try to turn the night to day,
Make flowers bloom along the way.</slide></presentation>
