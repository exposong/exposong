<presentation type="lyric"><title>Amazing Grace</title><slide title="Verse 1">Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That sav'd a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.</slide><slide title="Verse 2">'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears reliev'd;
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believ'd!</slide><slide title="Verse 3">Thro' many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.</slide><slide title="Verse 4">When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we've first begun.</slide></presentation>
