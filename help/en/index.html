<h1>About</h1>

<p>ExpoSong is a free, open-source, presentation program to assist with worship
assemblies. Create lyrics or plain-text slides, create schedules, and put up
slides on the screen.</p>



<h1>Schedules</h1>

<p>Schedules are used to create an order of presentations.</p>

<p>To create a schedule, in the menu, select Schedule->New. Name your schedule,
according to the date or event. Add songs to the schedule by dragging them from
the library onto the schedule.</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to clean up the schedules by deleting the old ones
when necessary.</p>



<h1>Creating Presentations</h1>

<p>Presentations are a set of slides to be presented on the screen. To create
a new presentation, on the menu, select Presentation->New, and then the
appropriate presentation type.</p>

<p>When editing, each paragraph is it's own slide.</p>

<p>The <b>text</b> presentation is used to create a non-specific, text slide.
It can be used for sermons, announcements, or anything else.</p>

<p>The <b>lyric</b> presentation is for song lyrics. It contains slide
descriptors, such as "Verse #", "Chorus", "Bridge", or "Refrain", which are
for the benefit of the presenter. There is an information tab, and the data
from this area, as well as the CCLI #, are displayed on the bottom of the
presentation screen.</p>



<h1>Backgrounds</h1>

<p>The background image for presentations can be a gradient or an
image file. Change the image by using the buttons next to the preview screen.</p>

<h2>Image Tips</h2>

<p>Background images should generally have a soft focus to them, and use a
minimal amount of contrast. Backgrounds with hard lines, or with many colors
make the text difficult to read.</p>
