<h1>About</h1>

<p>ExpoSong is a free, open-source, presentation program to assist with worship
assemblies. Create lyrics or plain-text slides, create schedules, and put up
slides on the screen.</p>



<h1>Schedules</h1>

<p>Schedules are used to create an order of presentations.</p>

<p>To create a schedule, in the menu, select Schedule-&gt;New. Name your schedule,
according to the date or event. Add songs to the schedule by dragging them from
the library onto the schedule.</p>



<h1>Creating Presentations</h1>

<p>Presentations are a set of slides to be presented on the screen. To create
a new presentation, on the menu, select Presentation-&gt;New, and then the
appropriate presentation type.</p>

<p>Add, edit, or delete slides using the toolbar buttons. You can drag and
drop slides to reorder the slides.</p>

<p>The <b>text</b> presentation is used to create a non-specific, text slide.
It can be used for sermons, announcements, or anything else.</p>

<p>The <b>lyric</b> presentation is for song lyrics. It contains slide
descriptors, such as "Verse #", "Chorus", "Bridge", or "Refrain", which are
for the benefit of the presenter. There is an information tab, and the data
from this area, as well as the CCLI #, are displayed on the bottom of the
presentation screen.</p>

<p>Lyric presentations can also be reordered. Use the letters use <i>v1</i> to
<i>v9</i> for a verse, <i>c</i> for chorus, <i>r</i> for refrain, <i>b</i> for
bridge, and <i>e</i> for ending.</p>

<p>The <b>image</b> presentation is used to present images. Add multiple images
at once by using [shift] or [control] in the add dialog. Rearrange images by
using drag-and-drop.</p>


<h1>Notifications</h1>

<p>You may have a need to notify someone in the audience of something, such as
a crying baby in the nursury. A notification can be used to let them know. The
notification can be set using the text box underneath the preview screen. Press
enter or the 2nd button next to it to set it to the screen. The clear button
directly next to the box will remove the notification.</p>


<h1>Backgrounds</h1>

<p>The background image for presentations can be a gradient or an
image file. Change the image by using the buttons next to the preview screen.</p>

<h2>Background Image Tips</h2>

<p>Background images should generally have a soft focus to them, and use a
minimal amount of contrast. Backgrounds with hard lines, or with many colors
make the text difficult to read.</p>
